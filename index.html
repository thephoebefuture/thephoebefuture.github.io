    Who is Phoebe Future?

    <p>
    From what I have gathered over the course of the past 365 calendar days, according to our society's construct of time, Phoebe Future is a young woman from the year 3030. I believe she is in her mid to late twenties. I have followed her time traveling journey and know for a fact that she is currently in sync with our current time dimension of November 2020. I have located the crash site of her time machine, which is in Black Rock Desert. She landed in March, right at the beginning of the pandemic. Her purpose here is still unknown to me, and of great interest. She seems to be searching for a specific person, and has an interest in the EDM and rave culture. I continue to watch Phoebe from afar, but I am determined to find out her mission here and what she can teach us about the future.

    Any close-up images of Phoebe have been either the result of my telephoto lens, or are captured from her instagram. You can follow her @iamphoebe.

     Disclaimer: I am not tracking her for malevolent or romantic interests. I am simply a scholar of Theoretical Physics, currently writing a book on the subject of time travel.

    I first discovered Phoebe Future when I was searching for evidence of time travellers in our universe. I created an algorithm to scour the web for patterns in facial features within different decades, and I found that Phoebe has appeared in photos spanning from the late 17th century to the 21st century. On this site you will be able to follow Phoebe's time travelling journey as I continue to discover and document it. If you have a run in with Ms. Phoebe would you kindly send an email to the link at the bottom of the page. Together we can solve this metaphysical wonder.
